    "# Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a personal project that I am creating, so that I may continue learning how regression works.  I will use data from data.org: HVAC Market Share by Efficiency and Capacity: Beginning 2017 summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary: HVAC Market Share by Efficiency and Capacity: Beginning 2017 dataset is based on heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) sales data reported to D+R International by Heating, Air-conditioning & Refrigeration Distributors International (HARDI) members participating in the Unitary HVAC Market Report. Participation in the report is voluntary for distributors. The dataset covers New York State and the Northeast (includes Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island). Blank cells represent data that are not currently available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this data set, I will use regression models with vizualizations, that may be of help to new data science students, but also show prospective employers my skills gained as a Data Science student at Codeup."
